  title: What is YAML?
  content:
  - |
    YAML is a computer data serialization language.
  - |
    A YAML document represents a computer program's native data structure in a human readable text form.
    A node in a YAML document can have three basic data types:
  - |
    <ul>
    <li>[Scalar](#topic:scalar)<br>
    Atomic data types like strings, numbers, booleans and null</li>
    <li>[Sequence](#topic:sequence)<br>
    A list of nodes</li>
    <li>[Mapping](#topic:mapping)</a><br>
    A map of nodes to nodes. Also known as Hashes, Hash Maps, Dictionaries or
    Objects.<br> Unlike in many programming languages, a key can be more than
    just a string.<br>
    It can be a sequence or mapping itself.</li>
    </ul>
  - |
    On top of that, YAML allows to serialize all other data types and classes:
  - |
    <ul>
    <li>[Alias and Anchor](#topic:alias)<br>
    For serializing References / Pointers, including circular references.
    </li>
    <li>[Tag](#topic:tag)<br>
    With Tags it's possible to define custom types/classes.<br>
    For example, in many languages a Regular Expression is a builtin data type
    or object.<br>
    Some languages have only arrays, which are represented by the basic
    sequence type.<br>
    But some have tuples, which needs a custom tag.
    </li>
    </ul>
  - Additionally to the indentation based [Block Style](#topic:block)
    there is a more compact [Flow Style](flowstyle.html)
    syntax.
  - One YAML File (or Stream) can consist of more than one
    [Document](document.html).

    The following examples will introduce you with YAML syntax elements step
    by step.

- name: invoice
  title: Invoice
  content:
  - Let's write an invoice.
  - It has a number, a name and an address, order items and more.
  - |
    <h3>Mapping</h3>
    The most common top level data type are mappings. A mapping maps values
    to keys.<br>
    Keys and values are separated with a colon and a space `: `.<br>
    Each Key/Value pair is on its own line.

  - yaml: |
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole
  - |
    An alternative way to write it:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus
      address: North Pole

  - |
    The `---` is explicity starting a [Document](#topic:document).
  - |
    It marks the following content as YAML, but it is optional.
  - |
    It has some use cases, and it is needed when you have multiple Documents
    in one file.
  - |
    Read more about it in the [Document Chapter](document.html).

  - |
    <h3>Nested Mappings</h3>
  - |
    Now we replace the `address` string with another mapping. In that case the
    colon is followed by a linebreak. Mapping values that are not scalars
    must always start on a new line.
  - |
    Nested items must always be indented more then the parent node, with at
    least one space. The typical indentation is two spaces.
  - |
    Tabs are forbidden as indentation.

  - yaml: |
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus

      address:
        street: Santa Claus Lane
        zip: 12345
        city: North Pole
  - |
    Don't forget the indentation. If you write it like this:
  - yaml: |
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus

      address:
      street: Santa Claus Lane
      zip: 12345
      city: North Pole
  - |
    ... then it will actually mean this:
  - yaml: |
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus

      address: null
      street: Santa Claus Lane
      zip: 12345
      city: North Pole

  - |
    <h3>Sequence</h3>
  - |
    A sequence is a list (or array) of scalars (or other sequences or
    mappings).<br> A sequence item starts with a hyphen and a space `- `.<br>
    Here is the list of
    YAML inventors:
  - yaml: |
      - Oren Ben-Kiki
      - Clark Evans
      - Ingy döt Net

  - |
    Now back to our invoice.<br>
    We map a list of scalars to the key `order items`.
  - |
    The sequence must start on the next line:
  - yaml: |
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus
      address:
        street: Santa Claus Lane
        zip: 12345
        city: North Pole

      order items:
        - Sled
        - Wrapping Paper

  - |
    Because the `- ` counts as indentation, you can also write it like this:
  - yaml: |
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus
      address:
        street: Santa Claus Lane
        zip: 12345
        city: North Pole

      order items:
      - Sled
      - Wrapping Paper

  - <h3>Nested Sequences</h3>
  - |
    You can also nest sequences. The typical example is a List of Dice Rolls.
  - |
    The nested sequence items can follow directly on the same line:
  - yaml: |
      ---
      - - 2
        - 3
      - - 3
        - 6

  - |
    YAML allows to write that in a more compact way, the [Flow
    Style](#topic:flowstyle):
  - yaml: |
      ---
      - [ 2, 3 ]
      - [ 3, 6 ]

  - |
    Read more about it in the [Flow Style Chapter](flowstyle.html).

  - <h3>Aliases / Anchors</h3>
  - |
    Let's add a billing address to the invoice.
  - |
    In our case it is the same as the shipping address.
    We rename `address` to `shipping address` and add `billing address`:
  - yaml: |
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus

      shipping address:
        street: Santa Claus Lane
        zip: 12345
        city: North Pole
      billing address:
        street: Santa Claus Lane
        zip: 12345
        city: North Pole

      order items:
      - Sled
      - Wrapping Paper

  - |
    Now that's a bit wasted space. If it's the same address, you don't need
    to repeat it. Use an [Alias](#topic:alias).
  - |
    In the native data structure of a programming language, this would be
    a reference, pointer, or alias.

  - |
    Before an [Alias](#topic:alias) can be used, it has to be created
    with an [Anchor](#topic:alias):

  - yaml: |
      invoice number: 314159
      name: Santa Claus

      shipping address: &address     #   Anchor
        street: Santa Claus Lane     # ┐
        zip: 12345                   # │ Anchor content
        city: North Pole             # ┘
      billing address: *address      #   Alias

      order items:
      - Sled
      - Wrapping Paper

  - |
    When loaded into a native data structure, the `shipping address` and
    `billing address` point to the same data structure.<br>
    It depends on the capabilities of the programming language how this is
    implemented internally.<br>

- name: config
  title: Configuration Management
  content:
  - |
    YAML is used in all kinds of applications as a configuration language.
  - <h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
  - |
    One category is the configuration of Continuous Integration systems.
  - |
    Here is a minimal example of a [GitHub Action
    Workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions).

  - yaml: |
      name: Linux
      on: [push]    # Compact Flow Style Sequence
      jobs:
        build:
          name: Run Tests
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
          - name: Say Hello
            run: echo hello

  - |
    The value for `steps` is a list of mappings. A mapping can start directly
    on the same line as the `-`.

  - |
    Usually a step has a `name`, which will be shown as the title when running
    the job, and a `run`, which is a shell command, or multiple commands.

  - |
    Let's add a more realistic scenario, with one step to checkout the
    code, and one with multiple commands.
  - |
    If you use Double Quotes, which work like JSON strings, it looks like
    this:
  - yaml: |
      steps:
      # Plugin provided by GitHub to checkout the code
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Run multiple commands
      - name: Run Tests
        run: "./configure\nmake\nmake test\n"
  - |
    One of the advantages of YAML here is that this can be formatted in a way
    that's easy to write and read with [Block Scalars](#topic:blockscalar):
  - yaml: |
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Tests
        run: |      # Literal Block Scalar
          ./configure
          make
          make test

  - |
    The [Literal Block Scalar](#topic:blockscalar), as the name says, contains
    the literal content of the string. Tabs and similar characters are always
    literal. All trailing spaces will be kept.

  - |
    Let's say, you have a number of longer commands that you would like to
    break up into multiple lines for readability:
  - yaml: |
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: >      # Folded Block Scalar
          apt-get update
          && apt-get install -y
          git tig vim jq tmux tmate git-subrepo cpanminus

          cpanm -n -l local
          YAML::PP YAML::XS ...

  - |
    The [Folded Block Scalar](#topic:blockscalar) is like the Literal Block
    Scalar, but with special folding rules.
  - |
    Consecutive lines starting at the same indentation level will be folded
    with spaces, and empty lines create a linebreak.
  - |
    Read more about [Block Scalars](#topic:blockscalar) and all other ways of
    quoting in the [Quoting Chapter](quote.html).

  - <h3>Variables</h3>
  - |
    YAML itself has no concept of "variables" or "functions".
  - |
    Systems like GitHub Actions usually provide a way to access certain
    information and environment variables with a Templating Syntax.
  - |
    We set up a "matrix" test to build the code with gcc and clang.

  - yaml: |
      strategy:
        matrix:
          compiler: [gcc, clang]
      steps:
      - ...

  - |
    The `strategy.matrix` entry will create <b>two</b> jobs instead of one,
    providing the `compiler` in a "context" item that we can pass as an
    environment variable to the step:

  - yaml: |
      strategy:
        matrix:
          compiler: [gcc, clang]
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Tests
        env:
          CC: ${{ matrix.compiler }}
        run: |
          ./configure
          make
          make test
  - |
    This sets the environment variable `CC` to `gcc` or `clang`, respectively.

  - |
    The `${{ matrix.compiler }}` syntax is not a special YAML syntax.<br>
    It is a simple plain scalar that could also have been written in quotes:
  - yaml: |
        env:
          CC: '${{ matrix.compiler }}'
  - |
    It's the GitHub Action application that recognizes such variables and
    replaces them with their content at runtime.

  - |
    Such variables can look different, depending on the application.
  - |
    For example, [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is using the
    [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) templating engine,
    where variables look like this:

  - yaml: |
      wuth_items: '{{ user.names }}'

  - |
    It is important to add quotes here, because the `{` at the start actually
    would start a [Flow Style Mapping](flowstyle.html) otherwise.<br>
  - |
    So it's clever that GitHub Actions chose the `${{ ... }}` syntax, because
    the `$` at the start is not special in YAML and doesn't need quotes.
